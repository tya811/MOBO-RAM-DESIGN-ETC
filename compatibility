Create Motherboards that have system clocks and  and clocks that are designed to override internal CPU/GPU clocks so that
you can use am amd8350 with DDR4 RAM, and then create backward compatible ram so that a ddr2 mobo can be recycled and used with ddr4 ram
and any processor. And make universal CPU sockets and and make GPU's that have multiple graphics cards on them.
